# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **TextBlob**, and **matplotlib**. The aim is to classify tweets into sentiments like positive, negative, or neutral and visualize the results.

## 📁 Files

- **Task_4.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, cleaning, sentiment analysis, and visualization.
- **twitter_training.csv**: Dataset file containing labeled tweets used for training and evaluation.

## 📌 Features

- Load and inspect Twitter sentiment dataset.
- Preprocess textual data for sentiment classification.
- Apply **TextBlob** to perform sentiment analysis.
- Visualize sentiment distribution using **matplotlib**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
